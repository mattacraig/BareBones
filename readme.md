##BareBones.css

###What is BareBones.css?
BareBones.css is a non-opinionated CSS framework that uses ~very~ few styles to help you get up and running asap!

###Features
- Written using Sass, and fully customizable(nearly every value is stored in a variable, giving you full control over your project)
- A fully responsive 12-column grid that utilizes Flexbox, which means no more pesky floats(actually, I'm gonna be working on a fallback for IE 9+. I'm not ~that~ irresponsible...)!
- Everything is relative. Font sizes(rem), gutters(percent-based), etc.
- Every major component of Barebones(grid, typography, etc.) is in a separate Sass file, which should make it easy for you to see what's goin on under the hood and make changes as needed


###Note
BareBones.css is still very much a work in progress, and there are still a few features that I would like to implement. I decided to release this out into the wild to hopefully get the community involved! If there are any features you'd like, or if you'd like to contribute, submit a pull request! I'll also gladly take any constructive criticism:)

##Todo
- Write documentation(!important)
- Add grid fallback(float or inline-block elements)
- Add grid offsets(push column x amount of columns)
- Add option to flip column order for mobile devices(if needed)
